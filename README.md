# TechAcademyLiveProject
Code snippets from doing the live project for The Tech Academy that included:
1. Adding photos to a travel web scraping application.

2. Creating a new app that we will use to scrape data from wikipedia using beautiful soup. This app will display information about the world that will be relevant to travelers.
